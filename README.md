## What is Performance-based Hiring?

Performance-based Hiring is an end-to-end, four-step process for hiring top talent. It is the only validated methodology that integrates [sourcing, screening, interviewing, and recruiting](https://www.louadlergroup.com/training/performance-based-hiring-for-recruiters/) into a seamless approach based on how top people look for, compare, and accept one position over another.

Top people are looking for growth, challenge, and learning opportunities, not another job. Since most are fully-employed, they areunwilling to fill out long applications or wade through job board postings to find something better than they already have. While they will explore new opportunities, their process for doing so is far different than that of the typical candidate. It’s more measured, based on an open exchange of information and an evaluation of their long-term and short-term situations in balance.

In order to attract and hire top talent, a company’s sourcing, interviewing, and recruiting processes must be modified to meet their unique needs. This is what Performance-based Hiring is about. Even more important, this is accomplished without compromising assessment accuracy or paying unnecessary salary premiums.
